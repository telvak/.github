## The Name

**Tel** comes from the Greek *tele* — meaning *far, at a distance*. It is the root of every word humanity has ever invented to describe sending something across space. Telegraph. Telephone. Television. Telecommunications. Every technology built to reach someone who is not here carries this prefix.

**Vak** (वाक्) comes from Sanskrit — one of the oldest structured languages ever spoken, over 3,500 years old. Vak is not simply the word for speech. In Vedic philosophy, Vak is the **primordial force of communication itself** — the sacred power that existed before creation, through which worlds were spoken into being. The Rigveda describes her as the force that *carries everything to everyone*.

Tel is the *engineering* of human connection. Vak is the *philosophy* of it.

For 3,500 years, humanity has been building Tel to serve Vak.

**Telvak is the platform that finally honors both.**
